abstract = {Stunting (length-for-age z score < −2) before 2 years of age has shown associations with poor child developmental indicators, but information at the population level is scarce in South Asia, the region with the highest burden of stunting. We examined associations between z scores (i.e., height for age [HAZ], weight for age [WAZ], and weight for height [WHZ]) and undernutrition (i.e., stunting [HAZ < −2], wasting [WHZ < −2], and underweight [WAZ < −2]) with learning/cognition and social–emotional development among children 36–59 months of age. Data from Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys in Bangladesh (n = 8,659), Bhutan (n = 2,038), Nepal (n = 2,253), and Pakistan (Punjab n = 11,369 and Sindh n = 6,718) were used. Children were considered developmentally “on-track” in learning/cognition or social–emotional domains if they met specific early child development criteria. Meta-analysis was conducted to examine regional associations, adjusting for socio-economic status, early childhood education, and quality of care. In a pooled sample, on-track learning/cognition development was positively associated with HAZ (OR = 1.17, 95% CI [1.07, 1.27]) and WAZ (OR = 1.18, 95% CI [1.07, 1.31]) and negatively associated with stunting (OR = 0.72, 95% CI [0.60, 0.86]) and underweight (OR = 0.75, 95% CI [0.66, 0.86]) but not associated with WHZ or wasting. On-track development of social–emotional domain was not associated with any z scores or undernutrition indicators. Across several countries of South Asia, stunted children were less likely to be developmentally “on track” for learning/cognition. It is likely that interventions that prevent stunting may benefit child development, leading to significant individual and societal gains given the large burden of child stunting in regions like South Asia.},

The results indicated significant positive effects of exposure to the program, aggregated across learning outcomes, and within each of the three outcome categories: cognitive outcomes, including literacy and numeracy; learning about the world, including health and safety knowledge; social reasoning and attitudes toward out-groups. The effects were significant across different methods, and they were observed in both low- and middle-income countries and also in high-income countries. The results are contextualized by considering the effects and reach of the program, relative to other early childhood interventions. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

New estimates, based on proxy measures of stunting and poverty, indicate that 250 million children (43%) younger than 5 years in low-income and middle-income countries are at risk of not reaching their developmental potential. There is therefore an urgent need to increase multisectoral coverage of quality programming that incorporates health, nutrition, security and safety, responsive caregiving, and early learning. Equitable early childhood policies and programmes are crucial for meeting Sustainable Development Goals, and for children to develop the intellectual skills, creativity, and wellbeing required to become healthy and productive adults. In this paper, the first in a three part Series on early childhood development, we examine recent scientific progress and global commitments to early childhood development. Research, programmes, and policies have advanced substantially since 2000, with new neuroscientific evidence linking early adversity and nurturing care with brain development and function throughout the life course.},

We investigated relationships between socioeconomic factors and brain morphometry, independently of genetic ancestry, among a cohort of 1,099 typically developing individuals between 3 and 20 years of age. Income was logarithmically associated with brain surface area. Among children from lower income families, small differences in income were associated with relatively large differences in surface area, whereas, among children from higher income families, similar income increments were associated with smaller differences in surface area. These relationships were most prominent in regions supporting language, reading, executive functions and spatial skills; surface area mediated socioeconomic differences in certain neurocognitive abilities. These data imply that income relates most strongly to brain structure among the most disadvantaged children.},

abstract = {Socioeconomic status (SES) is associated with childhood cognitive achievement. In previous research we found that this association shows neural specificity; specifically we found that groups of low and middle SES children differed disproportionately in perisylvian/language and prefrontal/executive abilities relative to other neurocognitive abilities. Here we address several new questions: To what extent does this disparity between groups reflect a gradient of SES-related individual differences in neurocognitive development, as opposed to a more categorical difference? What other neurocognitive systems differ across individuals as a function of SES? Does linguistic ability mediate SES differences in other systems? And how do specific prefrontal/executive subsystems vary with SES? One hundred and fifty healthy, socioeconomically diverse first-graders were administered tasks tapping language, visuospatial skills, memory, working memory, cognitive control, and reward processing. SES explained over 30% of the variance in language, and a smaller but highly significant portion of the variance in most other systems. Statistically mediating factors and possible interventional approaches are discussed. {\textcopyright} 2007 The Authors. Journal compilation {\textcopyright} 2007 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

abstract = {Background: Frailty is associated with healthy ageing, and it has been identified as a means of measuring older adults' physio-psychosocial health. We know about the ageing trends and common diseases of older adults living in South Asia, but literature to date does not widely feature their health status based on frailty, especially in Bangladesh. This study aims to understand the prevalence of frailty in Bangladeshi older adults; classify their health status; and investigate associated risk factors. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted in the north-eastern region (i.e. Sylhet City Corporation) of Bangladesh. Four hundred participants aged 55 years and above were randomly selected, attended a health assessment session and completed a multi-indicator survey questionnaire. We developed a 30-indicator Frailty Index (FI30) to assess the participant's health status and categorized: good health (no-frailty/Fit); slightly poor health (mild frailty); poor health (moderate frailty); and very poor health (severe frailty). Pearson chi-square test and binary logistic regression analysis were conducted. Results: The participants' mean age was 63.6 years, and 61.6% of them were assessed in poor to very poor health (moderate frailty/36.3% - severe frailty/25.3%). The eldest, female and participants from lower family income were found more frailty than their counterparts. Participants aged 70 years and above were more likely (adjusted OR: 4.23, 95% CI: 2.26–7.92, p < 0.0001) to experience frailty (medical conditions) than the pre-elderly age group (55–59 years). Female participants were more vulnerable (adjusted OR = 1.487, 95% CI: 0.84–2.64, p < 0.0174) to frailty (medical conditions) than male. Also, older adults who had higher family income (Income>$473.3) found a lower risk (adjusted OR: 0.294, 95% CI: 0.11–0.76, p < 0.011) of frailty (poor health). Conclusion: Our study results confirm the prevalence of frailty-related disorders in Bangladeshi older adults and highlight the importance of targeted clinical and community-led preventive care programs.},

Abstract: The overlay of the COVID-19 pandemic on the pandemic of physical inactivity has become a great concern. Both types of pandemics can decrease the health protection capacity and consequently increase complexity in human lives. This cross-sectional study intended to examine changes in physical activity and sedentary behaviors during the COVID-19 pandemic among university students in a second-tier city of Bangladesh. Two hundred and nine students responded to an online questionnaire administered via Google Survey. In addition to descriptive statistics, parametric and non-parametric tests for comparing means, medians and distributions were used to assess differences in activity traits before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. Results show that the occurrence of COVID-19 has significantly reduced the practice of walking and physical activities among the students. They are commonly motivated by introjected regulation. Father's occupation and the type of family of a student have significant influences on the total physical activity in either situation. Bangladeshi university students have, particularly, been perceived as not generally used to vigorous physical activities. They are inactive compared to students from other countries. Thus, the public health policymakers and the corresponding authority should inspire the students to be more physically active by implementing different strategies such as increasing bicycling and walking facilities on the campus.},

abstract = {The objective of this study was to evaluate the trend of reported case fatality rate (rCFR) of COVID-19 over time, using globally reported COVID-19 cases and mortality data. We collected daily COVID-19 diagnoses and mortality data from the WHO's daily situation reports dated January 1 to December 31, 2020. We performed three time-series models [simple exponential smoothing, auto-regressive integrated moving average, and automatic forecasting time-series (Prophet)] to identify the global trend of rCFR for COVID-19. We used beta regression models to investigate the association between the rCFR and potential predictors of each country and reported incidence rate ratios (IRRs) of each variable. The weekly global cumulative COVID-19 rCFR reached a peak at 7.23% during the 17th week (April 22-28, 2020). We found a positive and increasing trend for global daily rCFR values of COVID-19 until the 17th week (pre-peak period) and then a strong declining trend up until the 53rd week (post-peak period) toward 2.2% (December 29-31, 2020). In pre-peak of rCFR, the percentage of people aged 65 and above and the prevalence of obesity were significantly associated with the COVID-19 rCFR. The declining trend of global COVID-19 rCFR was not merely because of increased COVID-19 testing, because COVID-19 tests per 1,000 population had poor predictive value. Decreasing rCFR could be explained by an increased rate of infection in younger people or by the improvement of health care management, shielding from infection, and/or repurposing of several drugs that had shown a beneficial effect on reducing fatality because of COVID-19.},

abstract = {Introduction The rate of cesarean delivery (C-section) has been increasing worldwide, including Bangladesh, and it has a negative impact on the mother and child's health. Our aim was to examine the association between C-section and childhood diseases and to identify the key factors associated with childhood diseases. Methods We used four nationally representative data sets from multiple indicator cluster survey (MICS, 2012 and 2019) and Bangladesh Demographic and Health Survey (BDHS, 2011and 2014) and analyzed 25,270 mother-child pairs. We used the frequency of common childhood diseases (fever, short or rapid breaths, cough, blood in stools, and diarrhea) as our outcome variable and C-section as exposure variable. We included mother's age, place of residence, division, mother's education, wealth index, child age, child sex, and child size at birth as confounding variables. Negative binomial regression model was used to analyze the data. Results In the BDHS data, the prevalence of C-section increased from 17.95% in 2011 to 23.33% in 2014. Also, in MICS, the prevalence almost doubled over an eight-year period (17.74% in 2012 to 35.41% in 2019). We did not observe any significant effect of C-section on childhood diseases in both surveys. Only in 2014 BDHS, we found that C-section increases the risk of childhood disease by 5% [Risk Ratio (RR): 1.05, 95% CI: 0.95, 1.17, p = 0.33]. However, the risk of childhood disease differed significantly in all survey years by division, child's age, and child's size at birth after adjusting for important confounding variables. For example, children living in Chittagong division had a higher risk [(2011 BDHS RR: 1.22, 95% CI: 1.08, 1.38) and (2019 MICS RR: 1.21, 95% CI: 1.08, 1.35)] of having disease compared to Dhaka division. Maternal age, education, and wealth status showed significant differences with the outcome in some survey years. Conclusion Our study shows that C-section in Bangladesh continued to increase over time, and we did not find significant association between C-section and early childhood diseases. High C-section rate has a greater impact on maternal and child health as well as the burden on the health care system. We recommend raising public awareness of the negative impact of unnecessary C-section in Bangladesh.},

abstract = {The purpose of this study was to identify the specific aspects of social engagement that distinguish infants with autism from infants of similar age and developmental level who do not have autism. Ten parents of preschoolers with autism and 10 parents of matched children without autism were given a semistructured interview, the Detection of Autism by Infant Sociability Interview (DAISI), which elicits reports on whether 19 aspects of social engagement characteristic of typically developing infants were present at some time during the child's first 24 months. The reports of infants with autism differed from those of the control group on 16 items. Findings suggest that infants with autism have marked limitation in both person-to-person and person-person-object social engagement, in keeping with the theory that autism involves impairments in primary as well as secondary intersubjectivity (Hobson, 1993a).},

The study included a sample of 731 high-risk families recruited from Women, Infant, and Children Supplemental Nutrition Program settings in 3 geographically distinct areas. The results demonstrated that changes in positive parenting between the child ages of 2 and 3 were associated with higher scores on children's school-age academic achievement, as measured by the Woodcock-Johnson III (W-J) Academic Skills composite. Moreover, structural equation modeling revealed that random assignment to the intervention was associated with higher levels of children's academic achievement at age 5 and age 7.5 indirectly, through greater increases in parents' use of positive behavior support in intervention families than in control families. Results are discussed with respect to the potential of a brief parenting intervention for improving parenting practices that promote academic achievement up to 5 years later. The results have promising implications for efforts to promote child adaptation in the school environment. {\textcopyright}2013 American Psychological Association.},

abstract = {Introduction Early childhood development is key to achieving the Sustainable Development Goals and can be negatively influenced by many different adversities including violence in the home, neglect, abuse and parental ill-health. We set out to quantify the extent to which multiple adversities are associated with impaired early childhood growth & development. Methods This was a substudy of the SPRING cluster randomised controlled trial covering the whole population of 120 villages of rural India. We assessed all children born from 18 June 2015 for adversities in the first year of life and summed these to make a total cumulative adversity score, and four subscale scores. We assessed the association of each of these with weight-for-age z-score, length-for-age z-score, and the motor, cognitive and language developmental scales of the Bayley Scales of Infant Development III assessed at 18 months. Results We enrolled 1726 children soon after birth and assessed 1273 of these at both 12 and 18 months of age. There were consistent and strongly negative relationships between all measures of childhood adversity and all five child growth & development outcome measures at 18 months of age. For the Bayley motor scale, each additional adversity was associated with a 1.1 point decrease (95%CI -1.3, -0.9); for the cognitive scales this was 0.8 points (95%CI -1.0, -0.6); and for language this was 1.4 points (95%CI -1.9, -1.1). Similarly for growth, each additional adversity was associated with a -0.09 change in weight-for-age zscore (-0.11, -0.06) and -0.12 change in height-for-age z-score (-0.14, -0.09). Discussion Our results are the first from a large population-based study in a low/middle-income country to show that each increase in adversity in multiple domains increases risk to child growth and development at a very early age. There is an urgent need to act to improve these outcomes for young children in LMICs and these findings suggest that Early Childhood programmes should prioritise early childhood adversity because of its impact on developmental inequities from the very start.},

abstract = {Background: Approximately 250 million (43%) children under the age of 5 years in low- and middleincome countries (LMICs) are failing to meet their developmental potential. Risk factors are recognised to contribute to this loss of human potential. Expanding understanding of the risks that lead to poor outcomes and which protective factors contribute to resilience in children may be critical to improving disparities. Methods and findings: The Drakenstein Child Health Study is a population-based birth cohort in the Western Cape, South Africa. Pregnant women were enrolled between 20 and 28 weeks' gestation from two community clinics from 2012 to 2015; sociodemographic and psychosocial data were collected antenatally. Mothers and children were followed through birth until 2 years of age. Developmental assessments were conducted by trained assessors blinded to background, using the Bayley-III Scales of Infant and Toddler Development (BSID-III), validated for use in South Africa, at 24 months of age. The study assessed all available children at 24 months; however, some children were not able to attend, because of loss to follow-up or unavailability of a caregiver or child at the correct age. Of 1,143 live births, 1,002 were in follow-up at 24 months, and a total of 734 children (73%) had developmental assessments, of which 354 (48.2%) were girls. This sample was characterised by low household employment (n = 183; 24.9%) and household income (n = 287; 39.1% earning <R1,000 per month), and high prevalence of maternal psychosocial risk factors including alcohol use in pregnancy (n = 95; 14.5%), smoking (n = 241; 34.7%), depression (n = 156; 23.7%), lifetime intimate partner violence (n = 310; 47.3%), and history of maternal childhood trauma (n = 228; 34.7%). A high proportion of children were categorised as delayed (defined by scoring < -1 standard deviation below the mean scaled score calculated using the BSID-III norms from a United States population) in different domains (369 [50.5%] cognition, 402 [55.6%] receptive language, 389 [55.4%] expressive language, 169 [23.2%] fine motor, and 267 [38.4%] gross motor). Four hundred five (55.3%) children had >1 domain affected, and 75 (10.2%) had delay in all domains. Bivariate and multivariable analyses revealed several factors that were associated with developmental outcomes. These included protective factors (maternal education, higher birth weight, and socioeconomic status) and risk factors (maternal anaemia in pregnancy, depression or lifetime intimate partner violence, and maternal HIV infection). Boys consistently performed worse than girls (in cognition [$\beta$ = -0.74; 95% CI -1.46 to -0.03, p = 0.042], receptive language [$\beta$ = -1.10; 95% CI -1.70 to -0.49, p < 0.001], expressive language [$\beta$ = -1.65; 95% CI -2.46 to -0.84, p < 0.001], and fine motor [$\beta$ = -0.70; 95% CI -1.20 to -0.20, p = 0.006] scales). There was evidence that child sex interacted with risk and protective factors including birth weight, maternal anaemia in pregnancy, and socioeconomic factors. Important limitations of the study include attrition of sample from birth to assessment age and missing data in some exposure areas from those assessed. Conclusions: This study provides reliable developmental data from a sub-Saharan African setting in a well-characterised sample of mother-child dyads. Our findings highlight not only the important protective effects of maternal education, birth weight, and socioeconomic status for developmental outcomes but also sex differences in developmental outcomes and key risk and protective factors for each group.},

Design Meta-analysis using publicly available data from fifteen Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys (MICS-4) to assess the association between stunting and development, controlling for maternal education, family wealth, books in the home, developmentally supportive parenting and sex of the child, stratified by country prevalence of breast-feeding ('low BF'<90 %, 'high BF' ≥90 %). Ten-item Early Childhood Development Index (ECDI) scores assessed physical, learning, literacy/numeracy and socio-emotional developmental domains. Children on track in three or four domains were considered 'on-track' overall. Setting Fifteen low- and middle-income countries. Subjects Publically available data from 58 513 children aged 36-59 months. Results Severe stunting (height-for-age Z-score <-3) was negatively associated with on-track development (OR=0{\textperiodcentered}75; 95 % CI 0{\textperiodcentered}67, 0{\textperiodcentered}83). Any stunting (Z-score <-2) was negatively associated with on-track development in countries with high BF prevalence (OR=0{\textperiodcentered}82; 95 % CI 0{\textperiodcentered}75, 0{\textperiodcentered}89). Severe and any stunting were negatively associated with physical development (OR=0{\textperiodcentered}77; 95 % CI 0{\textperiodcentered}66, 0{\textperiodcentered}89 and OR=0{\textperiodcentered}82; 95 % CI 0{\textperiodcentered}74, 0{\textperiodcentered}91, respectively) and literacy/numeracy development in high BF countries (OR=0{\textperiodcentered}45; 95 % CI 0{\textperiodcentered}38, 0{\textperiodcentered}53 and OR=0{\textperiodcentered}59, 95 % CI 0{\textperiodcentered}51, 0{\textperiodcentered}68, respectively), but not low BF countries (OR=0{\textperiodcentered}93; 95 % CI 0{\textperiodcentered}70, 1{\textperiodcentered}23 and OR=0{\textperiodcentered}95, 95 % CI 0{\textperiodcentered}79, 1{\textperiodcentered}12, respectively). Any stunting was negatively associated with learning (OR=0{\textperiodcentered}79; 95 % CI 0{\textperiodcentered}72, 0{\textperiodcentered}88). There was no clear association between stunting and socio-emotional development. Conclusions Stunting is associated with many but not all developmental domains across a diversity of countries and cultures. However, associations varied by country breast-feeding prevalence and developmental domain.},

The family care indicators (FCIs) were developed to measure home stimulation in large populations and were derived from the Home Observations for Measurement of the Environment (HOME). The FCIs were piloted with 801 rural Bangladeshi mothers of children aged 18 months. Five subscales were created: 'play activities' (PA), 'varieties of play materials' (VP), 'sources of play materials', 'household books', and 'magazines and newspapers' (MN). All subscales had acceptable short-term reliability. Mental and motor development of the children was assessed on the Bayley Scales of Infant Development and their language expression and comprehension by mothers' report. After controlling for socioeconomic variables, VP and PA independently predicted four and three of the developmental outcomes respectively, and MN predicted both the Bayley scores.

abstract = {SUMMARY: This report documents the development and validation of the Early Childhood Development Index (ECDI). The ECDI is a population-based measure included in Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys, the UNICEF- supported international household surveys known as ‘MICS'. These surveys are central to UNICEF's strategy for helping countries improve data collection and analysis on the situation of children and women. The findings generated through MICS have been used extensively in policy decisions, programme interventions and public outreach. The ECDI began to materialize when UNICEF, working with countries and partners, designed indicators to assess the quality of a child's home environment and access to early childhood care and education. Countries included these indicators during the third round of MICS (MICS3), which was implemented mainly in 2005 and 2006. In early 2006, work towards further development of the index employed a multi-method approach to scale construction. To establish the reliability and validity of the survey items, analyses for psychometric validation of the ECDI were applied at each stage in the development process, which also included an extensive literature review and pilot testing. The first version of the scale consisted of 48 items (questions) across six developmental domains. The final version was introduced in 2009 in the fourth round of MICS (MICS4) and also implemented in MICS5. It includes 10 items in four early developmental domains: language/cognitive (3 items), physical (2 items), social-emotional (3 items) and approaches to learning (2 items). Questions are included in the Early Childhood Development module of the Questionnaire for Children under Five in MICS and are addressed to mothers (or caretakers) of children aged 3 and 4 years. The ECDI is one of the first population-based measures of early childhood development available at an internationally comparative level. It has been incorporated into around 80 national and subnational MICS in low- and middle-income countries since its introduction.},

There are few national statistics on the development of young children in developing countries. We therefore identified two factors with available worldwide data-the prevalence of early childhood stunting and the number of people living in absolute poverty-to use as indicators of poor development. We show that both indicators are closely associated with poor cognitive and educational performance in children and use them to estimate that over 200 million children under 5 years are not fulfilling their developmental potential. Most of these children live in south Asia and sub-Saharan Africa. These disadvantaged children are likely to do poorly in school and subsequently have low incomes, high fertility, and provide poor care for their children, thus contributing to the intergenerational transmission of poverty. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Background: The development of cognitive and socioemotional skills early in life influences later health and well-being. Existing estimates of unmet developmental potential in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) are based on either measures of physical growth or proxy measures such as poverty. In this paper we aim to directly estimate the number of children in LMICs who would be reported by their caregivers to show low cognitive and/or socioemotional development. Methods and Findings: The present paper uses Early Childhood Development Index (ECDI) data collected between 2005 and 2015 from 99,222 3- and 4-y-old children living in 35 LMICs as part of the Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey (MICS) and Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) programs. First, we estimate the prevalence of low cognitive and/or socioemotional ECDI scores within our MICS/DHS sample. Next, we test a series of ordinary least squares regression models predicting low ECDI scores across our MICS/DHS sample countries based on country-level data from the Human Development Index (HDI) and the Nutrition Impact Model Study. We use cross-validation to select the model with the best predictive validity. We then apply this model to all LMICs to generate country-level estimates of the prevalence of low ECDI scores globally, as well as confidence intervals around these estimates. In the pooled MICS and DHS sample, 14.6% of children had low ECDI scores in the cognitive domain, 26.2% had low socioemotional scores, and 36.8% performed poorly in either or both domains. Country-level prevalence of low cognitive and/or socioemotional scores on the ECDI was best represented by a model using the HDI as a predictor. Applying this model to all LMICs, we estimate that 80.8 million children ages 3 and 4 y (95% CI 48.1 million, 113.6 million) in LMICs experienced low cognitive and/or socioemotional development in 2010, with the largest number of affected children in sub-Saharan Africa (29.4.1 million; 43.8% of children ages 3 and 4 y), followed by South Asia (27.7 million; 37.7%) and the East Asia and Pacific region (15.1 million; 25.9%). Positive associations were found between low development scores and stunting, poverty, male sex, rural residence, and lack of cognitive stimulation. Additional research using more detailed developmental assessments across a larger number of LMICs is needed to address the limitations of the present study. Conclusions: The number of children globally failing to reach their developmental potential remains large. Additional research is needed to identify the specific causes of poor developmental outcomes in diverse settings, as well as potential context-specific interventions that might promote children's early cognitive and socioemotional well-being.},

abstract = {Background and Objective: Few studies have examined the relationship between paternal stimulation and children's growth and development, particularly in low-and middle-income countries (LMICs). This study aimed to estimate the prevalence of paternal stimulation and to assess whether paternal stimulation was associated with early child growth and development. METHODS: Data from the Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys rounds 4 and 5 were combined across 38 LMICs. The sample comprised 87 286 children aged 3 and 4 years. Paternal stimulation was measured by the number of play and learning activities (up to 6) a father engaged in with his child over the past 3 days. Linear regression models were used to estimate standardized mean differences in height-for-age z-scores and Early Childhood Development Index (ECDI) z-scores across 3 levels of paternal stimulation, after controlling for other caregivers' stimulation and demographic covariates. RESULTS: A total of 47.8% of fathers did not engage in any stimulation activities, whereas 6.4% of fathers engaged in 5 or 6 stimulation activities. Children whose fathers were moderately engaged in stimulation (1-4 activities) showed ECDI scores that were 0.09 SD (95% confidence interval [CI]:-0.12 to-0.06) lower than children whose fathers were highly engaged; children whose fathers were unengaged showed ECDI scores that were 0.14 SD lower (95% CI:-0.17 to-0.12). Neither moderate paternal stimulation nor lack of paternal stimulation was associated with height-for-age z-scores, relative to high stimulation. CONCLUSION Increasing paternal engagement in stimulation is likely to improve early child development in LMICs.},

abstract = {<p>Osteoporosis is related to the decrease in bone mineral density. To diagnose osteoporosis and to assess its severity BMD measurement is a widely used method by using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA). BMD is an essential component of the assessment of bone quality and is utilized to assess the osteoporotic status of the bone for the prevention of osteoporotic fractures. The objective of this study was assessed to analyze the correlation between BMD with BMI and age. The study was conducted on 154 patients who performed the BMD test between the periods of January 2018 to July 2019. BMD of the lumbar spine (LS) and right femoral neck (FN) were measured using the DEXA method. In statistical analysis, the BMD status was compared according to age, gender, and BMI. Correlation among BMD, BMI, and age was analyzed with the nonparametric method (spearman rank correlation). SPSS software version 25 was used for analysis. Age showed highly significant negative correlations with all skeletal sites examined. Assessments on the T-score of FN and BMI were significantly related (p<0.05, r=0.223, positive relation). T-score of LS and BMI were positively correlated (r=0.484) and it was significant at a 95% level of significance. Both FN and LS T-score and showed a negative correlation, but it was significant. BMI and age were not significantly associated (p>0.05, r=-0.080, negative relation). As expected, the FN T-score and LS T-score showed a high correlation (r=0.484) between each other, and they were positive. Significant correlations were observed among BMD, BMI, and age of the patients. To identify the cause of osteoporosis, BMI and patients age can be considered as risk factors during BMD study. Our hope is that future research will reveal osteoporosis prevention targets effective for the growing population of aging men and women.&#13; Asian J. Med. Biol. Res. March 2021, 7(1): 76-81</p>},
